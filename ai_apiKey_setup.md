Exactly âœ…

Hereâ€™s the flow:

1. In your repo go to:
   **Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions â†’ New repository secret**

   * Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   * Value: `sk-xxxxxx` (your real key)

2. In your workflow YAML you reference it like this:

```yaml
- name: ðŸ¤– Run Sitemap + AI Lighthouse Audit
  env:
    OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}   # <-- this pulls your saved secret
  run: npm run analysis:human
```

3. When GitHub Actions runs:

   * It looks up the secret `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   * Injects its value into the jobâ€™s environment
   * Inside your Node script (`ai_site_analysis.js`), you read it with:

     ```js
     process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
     ```

So yes â€” once you add the secret in GitHub, that line
`OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}`
will automatically make it available in the step.
